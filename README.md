Some core measures used:
```DAX
Total Songs = COUNTROWS('spotify-top-50-world')

Unique Artists = DISTINCTCOUNT('spotify-top-50-world'[artist])

Average Popularity = AVERAGE('spotify-top-50-world'[popularity])

Explicit Songs % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('spotify-top-50-world'), 'spotify-top-50-world'[is_explicit] = TRUE()),
    [Total Songs],
    0
)

Average Duration (min) = AVERAGE('spotify-top-50-world'[duration_ms]) / 60000
